## Introduction:
Just a very basic addon that "catches" boards redirection to external websites (actually, any redirect that passes through redirectexit) and presents a screen informing the user he is leaving the original site.

It doesn't work on links posted in messages.

## Installation:
{% include install_std.MD %}

### License:
{% include license.MD param="bsd" %}
