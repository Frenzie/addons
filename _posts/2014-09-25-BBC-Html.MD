## Introduction:
The HTML bbcode allows to use plain html in posts.
This particular bbcode can be used only by admins, and even so it can be a security risk, so use it only if you don't have any other alternative. And even so, before using it consider the possibility to create a bbcode specific for the effect you are trying to obtain.

## Installation:
{% include install_std.MD %}

### License:
{% include license.MD param="bsd" %}
