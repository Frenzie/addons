## Introduction:
The addon adds a "tabbed interface" to the post form. The smileys are organized in "tabs": the first tab contains all the smileys configured to appear in the post form, the "additional tabs" are defined based on the number of rows of smileys present in the popup (one row = one tab). You can add new rows of smileys from the admin panel, in set smiley order.

## Installation:
{% include install_std.MD %}
