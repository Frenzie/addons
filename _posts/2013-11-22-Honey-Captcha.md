## Introduction:
Honey Captcha is a addon that creates a fake CAPTCHA field, usually hidden outside the screen so that humans are not able to see it. But bots find it and fill it, so...bam! If something is in there, bots are rejected. :P

## Options:
Honey Captcha doesn't have any configuration option.

## Installation:
{% include install_std.MD %}

### License:
{% include license.MD param="bsd" %}
