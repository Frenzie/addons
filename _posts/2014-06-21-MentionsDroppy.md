## Introduction:
We know mentions require quick interaction, and the current ElkArte page may be annoying to many. Well, this is a first attempt at making it easier to use and more similar to what many of you are already used. The mentions menu becomes an AJAX-ively loaded dropdown that will display the 5 most recent mentions you have received, when the dropdown is opened, it will also mark those mentions as read.

## Installation:
{% include install_std.MD %}
