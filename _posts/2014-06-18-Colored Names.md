## Introduction:
Many people like to be different, and this is the second step in the online world to be different: change the color of the display name.
At the moment the addon is very basic, it allows a fixed number of elements to be customized: color, background, size, border (style, width, color, border radius), but it already covers most of the needs.

## Future development:
-  allow the admin to decide what users can customize,
-  add permissions (if requested)
-  other suggested ideas.

## Installation:
{% include install_std.MD %}

### License:
{% include license.MD param="bsd" %}
