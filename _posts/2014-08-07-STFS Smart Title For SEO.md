## Features:

1. Please do your own backup though every installation is backed up automatically.
2. On default the "- Index" can be seen on the browser as forum index page title and this mod when enabled will remove it.
3. This mod will now also change your forum title from "page title" to "forum name - page title".
4. Upon its successful installation, you will be directed to addons page where you can enable/disable this mod.
5. There is nothing fancy about this mod as it is just a simple trick to boost a bit of SEO (at least IMO).
6. You can test it in lower version too as IMO it should work just fine. ;)

## Installation:
