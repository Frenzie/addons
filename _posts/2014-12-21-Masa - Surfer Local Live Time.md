## Features:

1. Please do your own backup though every installation is backed up automatically.
2. On default, the time is not shown in the header either for member or for guest.
3. This addon will add surfer's local date and live time, so one can keep track to it while in the forum.
4. All you need to do is turn it on or off in Addons Settings page, save it and you are good to go.
5. You have the option to change the date format. Click here for reference.
6. Admin can choose whether the live time and date is shown or hidden to guest.
7. The css for both besocial and light is also added to make the mode suitable for both variant.
8. You can test it in all Elk 1.0.x lower version as IMO it should work just fine. ;)
