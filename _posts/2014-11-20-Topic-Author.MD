## Introduction:
This mod is simple - it adds small icon next to name of user who started topic. Useful in topics with several pages - you always know who started viewed topic.

Currently there are two icons available, star and 'comment cloud', both are taken from Font Awesome which is included in ElkArte by default.

## Installation:
{% include install_std.MD %}

### License:
{% include license.MD param="MPL 1.1" %}
